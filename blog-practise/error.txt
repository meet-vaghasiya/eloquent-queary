1. call UserSeeder in DataBaseSeeder to call UserSeeder   $this->call(UserSeeder::class)
2. use UserSeeder instead of User in DataBaseSeeder file otherwise it will give call is not define in User::setContainer error
3. don't forgot to call create method in seeder otherwise seeder is run but don't create any seeder in database.
    User::factory()->count(10)->create()
