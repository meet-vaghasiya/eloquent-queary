1. always user -mcr or -mcrfs for creating migration,controller ,resouce ,factory and seeder with model like php artisan make:model Post -mcrfs or use --all


2. tampor monkey script for dump data expansion:     
        var compacted = document.querySelectorAll('.sf-dump-compact');

        for (var i = 0; i < compacted.length; i++) {
        compacted[i].className = 'sf-dump-expanded';
        
        }


  3. if we use search like where,orWhere,orWhre than use search by FULLTEXT INDEX  method which is faster than index in all  column  at once like bellow.

DB::statement('ALTER TABLE POST ADD FULL TEXT fulltext_index_for_posts(title,content) ') 


4. in passing string: 'abc xyz mno'=> 'means column should content any one from all'
4.  'abc +xyz mno'=> 'means column must content xyz and any one from  abc or mno'
4.  'abc +xyz -mno'=> 'means column must content xyz and must not content mno. also added which includes abc'
